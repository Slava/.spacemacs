#+TITLE: Alternative Typescript Layer
#+HTML_HEAD_EXTRA: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../css/readtheorg.css" />

* Description
This is an alternative layer to Spacemacs stock Typescript layer. Unlike the
stock layer, this one uses =tide= instead of =tss= and runs the recommended
configuration of the package.

* Install
First, clone this layer into your =~/.emacs.d/private/= folder.

To use this contribution add it to your =~/.spacemacs=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(typescript))
#+end_src

* Key bindings

| Key Binding   | Description          |
|---------------+----------------------|
| ~<SPC> m g d~ | Jump to definition   |
| ~<SPC> m g g~ | Jump to definition   |
| ~<SPC> m d~   | Jump to definition   |
| ~<SPC> m g r~ | Find references      |
| ~<SPC> m r~   | Rename symbol        |
| ~<SPC> m f~   | Re-format the buffer |

"Jump to definition" binding appears so many times to provide a short-cut as
well as a mnemonic.
